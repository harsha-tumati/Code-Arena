        # Code Arena Fullstack

        This project is a Firebase‑first coding competition platform.

        ## Prerequisites

        * Node.js ≥ 16
* Python ≥ 3.8
* Firebase CLI (`npm i -g firebase-tools`)
* A Firebase project with Firestore, Storage, Functions, and Hosting enabled

        ## Setup

        ```bash
        git clone <repo-or-copy>
        cd code-arena
        npm install           # installs React & Webpack deps
        cd functions && npm install && cd ..   # Cloud Functions deps
        ```

        Add your **Firebase keys** in `src/firebase.js` and your **game engine** in `functions/engine/`.

        ### Local dev

        ```bash
        npm run start        # React dev server at http://localhost:3000
        firebase emulators:start  # separate terminal, to test functions
        ```

        ### Production build & deploy

        ```bash
        npm run build        # bundles to /public
        firebase deploy      # hosting + functions + rules
        ```

        ## Folder overview

        * `/src` – React front‑end (Login → Team → Upload → Preview → Leaderboard-> Preview)
* `/functions` – Cloud Functions (auto‑score uploads, run playoffs)
* `/public` – Static host root (webpack outputs bundle here)
* `.firebaserc`, `firebase.json`, `firestore.rules` – Firebase config & security

* Explored Day.js for efficient and lightweight date/time formatting. Used throughout the UI to display readable timestamps for uploads and matches.
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/dayjs
* Followed official Firebase docs to set up:

  Firestore (real-time database for teams, users, submissions),

  Firebase Storage (for bots and match logs),

  Firebase Functions (backend logic for scoring and game orchestration),

  and Firebase Hosting.

* Studied React Hooks to manage state and side effects using useState, useEffect, useCallback, and more, enabling clean and reactive component logic.
  https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks
* Learned how to use Webpack to bundle React code and serve it to the browser.
  https://webpack.js.org/
* Integrated Codeium’s browser-based code editor to allow in-app bot development with syntax highlighting, providing a better UX for coding directly in the browser.

* Learned how to use Firebase Authentication to securely authenticate users and manage user data.
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start
* Learned how to use Firebase Cloud Functions to orchestrate game logic and run automated tasks.
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started
* Learned how to use Firebase Hosting to serve static assets and host a React app.
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/get-started
* Learned how to use Firebase Cloud Firestore to store and query data.
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart
* Learned how to use Firebase Cloud Storage to store and serve bot code.
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/start
* Learnt usage of Postman
In the initial backend prototyping phase, I used Postman to test and verify Firebase Function endpoints, simulate authenticated calls, and debug request/response flows before UI integration.
* Used to parse log.csv files generated by matches. The parsed data powers a canvas-based animation to visually replay match simulations between bots.
